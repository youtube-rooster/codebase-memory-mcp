# processes of the already-built test-runner.
#
# ZERO-LOSS CONTRACT (gate quality must be identical to the sequential run):
#   1. The suite list comes from `test-runner --list-suites`, which is printed
#      by the SAME macro table that executes suites — the list cannot drift
#      from reality by construction.
#   2. UNION GUARD: after the run, the set of suites that actually produced a
#      result is compared against that list; any difference (a suite that
#      never ran, or ran twice) fails the gate loudly. A newly added suite is
#      picked up automatically on the next invocation.
#   3. Per-suite pass/fail/skip counts are summed and reported in the same
#      "N passed[, M failed][, K skipped]" shape as the sequential runner, so
#      before/after totals are directly comparable.
#   4. ANY suite failing, crashing (nonzero exit), or missing ⇒ exit 1.
#
# Usage: run-tests-parallel.sh <path-to-test-runner> [jobs]

# Timing-sensitive suites run SEQUENTIALLY after the parallel wave: they

# flakes (3 cli-suite failures on the ubuntu legs of the first CI run).
# Same suites, same tests, same gates — only the schedule differs; the
# union guard below still checks the COMBINED result set.
# stack_overflow_a/b/c: their giant-recursion ASan allocations stall ~100x
# when co-STARTED with a large wave on Apple Silicon (2s staggered vs ~230s
# simultaneous — a local scheduler/zone quirk, not contention: job count
# does not change it). Staggered in the tail they cost seconds.
# The daemon-family suites spawn coordinated worker subprocesses (a re-exec
# of this ASan runner plus the full admission handshake) and bind local
# endpoints under fixed readiness deadlines (3 s marker waits in
# index_supervisor); the saturated 3-core macOS CI runners starve those
# deadlines into deterministic failures while an idle machine passes 6/6.
# They also all rendezvous through the shared per-account runtime namespace,
# which the quiet tail keeps free of cross-suite admission traffic.
# extraction carries the wide-flat SCALING-RATIO guard, which grows the input
# 20x and asserts the time grows ~20x (linear) rather than ~128x (quadratic),
# with a bound of 40x between them. Contention does not cancel out of that
# ratio: the 400k-node measurement loses far more to memory pressure and
# scheduling than the 20k one, so oversubscription inflates the ratio itself.
# Measured on the Windows arm64 VM: 18.5x alone (passes) vs 53.8x and 55x in
# the 18-job wave (fails) — reproducible, 3 of 3. The bound is deliberately NOT
# widened; see the calibration note in tests/test_extraction.c, which records
# that 40 sits >=2x from both the linear and quadratic signals, so inflating it
# would move the test toward the very thing it exists to catch. Quiet is the
# fix, and at ~22s the suite is cheap to run alone.
